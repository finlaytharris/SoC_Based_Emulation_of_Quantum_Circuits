# SoC-Based Quantum Circuit Emulator  
**Hardware-Accelerated Quantum Gates & QFT on Ultra96-V2 MPSoC**  


## General Description of the Project  

Quantum computing promises exponential speedups but physical quantum processors remain noisy, resource-limited, and expensive. Classical emulators provide accessibility, but software-only approaches lack the speed and parallelism needed to resemble real hardware.  

This project introduces a **System-on-Chip (SoC) based quantum circuit emulator** built on the **Avnet Ultra96-V2 MPSoC (Zynq UltraScale+)**. It combines FPGA parallelism with interactive Python tools for **real-time emulation of quantum gates and algorithms**.  

The design implements fundamental **single- and two-qubit gates (X, Y, Z, H, S, T, SWAP)** and a **3-qubit Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)** in FPGA logic, with **Python + Voila dashboards** for Bloch sphere visualisation and interactive experimentation.  

This contribution demonstrates how **SoC-based emulation** bridges the gap between theoretical algorithms and practical research/education by enabling fast, open, and reusable **quantum-classical hybrid experimentation**.

## How to Build & Run  

### Quickstart (Prebuilt Bitstream)  

- Clone this repo on the Ultra96-V2  
- Load the bitstream from /bitstreams onto the PL  
- Start Jupyter Lab  
- Open notebooks:  
  - notebooks/gate_demo.ipynb â†’ test single-qubit & two-qubit gates  
  - notebooks/qft_demo.ipynb â†’ run a 3-qubit QFT demo  
- For GUI-only interaction (no notebook editing), launch with Voila:  
  - voila notebooks/qft_demo.ipynb  

### Build from Source  

- Open /hardware in Model Composer  
- Generate HDL and export to Vivado  
- Build the bitstream and save in /bitstreams  
- Deploy on Ultra96-V2 via PYNQ

## ðŸ“Š Results  

- Pauli gates: errors â‰¤ 1e-10, latency ~2 ms  
- Hadamard: superpositions correct, errors up to ~45% (fixed-point limits)  
- S, T, SWAP gates: < 1e-5 error, latency 2â€“3 ms  
- 3-qubit QFT: ~2.8% average error, 8 ms runtime, phase errors from quantisation  
- GUI visualisation validated correctness via Bloch sphere plots
